# The Beep-Boop Translator

#### Week 3 Independent Project Regarding Beeps and Boops, January 27, 2019

#### By Jasmine Lee

## Description
  This is my third independent project. It demonstrates arrays, looping, and how to take a user's input and return information. In this case, it takes a user's number and returns the numbers from zero to the number inputted.

## Specifications
  This webpage allows a user to input a number. It lists all of the numbers from zero to that input. Below, is a list of characteristics. The numbers between zero and the input that follow any of these characteristics will be replaced accordingly:

  * Any multiple of 3 within the inputed value will be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." (If the user inputs a name in the "Please Enter Name" text box, the name is swapped in place of Dave.)
  * Any number with a 1 is replaced with "Boop!"
  * Any number with a 0 is replaced with "Beep!"
